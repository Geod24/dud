# Derivation

Let $I$ be the set of all $N$ incompatibilities.
Let $D$ be the set of all $M$ decisions.
A decision is term/version selection that was selected to be part of the
eventual solution.

Let $|i_{j}|$ be number of terms in incompatibility $j$.

If term $t \in i_{j}$ then $t \not\in {i_{j} \setminus t}$

Let S be ${ x \in I | x \ D }$.
Let R be ${ y \in S | |y| = 1}$.
